# Ord text editor
A text editor written in Python with GTK and Adwaita. I made this just for fun, so it's very barebones and I most likely won't continue working on it. If you want, you could use this as a replacement for Microsoft Word... but just don't
Some of this was pregenerated by the GNOME Foundation's [IDE](https://apps.gnome.org/Builder/), however I've programmed all the actual text editor functionality.

## What does Ord offer? 
Ord offers your usual text editing bliss, like opening files, editing files, and saving files... Woah, so cool!

## Why use Ord instead of *anything* else?
There is absolutely no reason. Don't. It would be cool if you did, but just don't. You should use Ord Online instead! It is the best text editor known to man, and it now has functionality for accounts and multiple documents!

## What do I plan on adding in the future?
Other colour schemes, other fonts and markdown support
