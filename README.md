# Ord text editor
A text editor written in Python with GTK and Adwaita. I made this just for fun, so it's very barebones and I most likely won't continue working on it. If you want, you could use this as a replacement for Microsoft Word... but just don't

## What does Ord offer? 
Ord offers your usual text editing bliss, like opening files, editing files, and saving files... Woah, so cool!

## Why use Ord instead of *anything* else?
There is absolutely no reason. Don't. It would be cool if you did, but just don't.

## What do I plan on adding into Ord in the future?
Custom colour themes, other fonts, markdown support, and maybe some telemetry which I can send to my website for an active user tracker (taking inspiration from Microsoft on that one)

## Windows binary? 
idk
